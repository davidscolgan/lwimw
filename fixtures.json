        "description": "Hey Everyone,\r\n\r\nThank you for checking out my entry! This game \"Switch: Interdimensional Puzzling!\" is my FIRST EVER released title, so I am really excited to be able to bring it to you. It's been a lot of work. 25+ Hours across the two days, and a bunch of headaches, plus a last minute mechanic scrap because Game Maker refused to work, but after all that, I'm happy with the final product. (Could do without the \"Made With Game Maker Light\" watermark, though.)\r\n\r\nSwitch is a game about speedrunning through levels, completing tasks in a particular order in order to move through the levels. Discovering which routes or techniques are fastest, how to use and abuse the collision/physics engine, and trying to figure out which tasks are necessary/worth doing will all help you get the fastest time.\r\n\r\nThere are a few bugs and errors, and the collision system is meh, but I actually think that the collision makes the game better in a way, allows for a little but more free, not so rigid movement system, where some of the rules of how to move are determined by how you play (If that makes sense to anyone but me.) \r\n\r\nControls:\r\n\r\nArrow Keys Or WASD: Move\r\n\r\nSpace: Swap Worlds\r\n\r\nEnter: Go Through Door\r\n\r\nMay continue this game, will probably be making a Post-Mortem, and will fix any bugs or errors that are brought to my attention to help the game play better. (You can send bugs, etc to 0CredsMail@Gmail.com) The person to post of screencap of the end screen with the lowest score + highest gems by Monday will be given 2500 Creds ($25.00) to spend @ 0credsstore.tumblr.com (Please don't break the game or use Photoshop, I'm trying to make things fun for you all, and all I ask is that you don't take advantage of my kindness.)\r\n\r\nThe First Link Below Is The COMPO Version, The Second Will Be The Continually Updated POST COMPO Version. (There are a few bugs in the first version, mainly, the game doesn't note your score.) (Cause I'm an idiot) (And cause I forgot to check \"Visible\")... #WhyIDoDis\r\n\r\nThanks Again Everyone,\r\n\r\n- 0Creds",

I'm really happy with what I got done since I did even more than what I originally set out to do in the first place. I added a health system, created an entity removal system, made it so that when an entity is killed it is removed from the level, added sounds for hitting an enemy and being hit, added knockback for hitting enemies, added a blocking mechanic, and made blood particles shoot out of something (the player or the enemy) when it is hit.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I didn't get to was making good art for everything (I just threw together some basic coder art), but I'm really not too worried about that since I really just wanted to focus on coding the actual mechanics of everything.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a great weekend and I can't wait for LWIMW IV.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to make a submission video in time, but I'll definitely put one up on Monday, so I'll link you guys to my Youtube channel so you can check it out when it's uploaded (also feel free to look at all my other development videos of my game). :)\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, the enemies are squids, cuz why not? :P",

It's a small desktop app that shows me all streamers I follow that are live, notifies me when somebody goes live and allows me to start streams in frameless VLC windows with one click.\r\n\r\nI mainly wrote it because I've missed the start of a lot of streams because twitch sometimes takes really long to send out live notification emails. I also like to watch streams in VLC instead of chrome because FlashPlayer performance and CPU usage in Mac OS is horrible, so it's very nice to have hardware accelerated playback in frameless windows I can completely freely resize and move everywhere on my screen.\r\n\r\nStuff used: node.js, anuglarjs, node-webkit, coffeescript, bootstrap, ...\r\nIt's not very pretty, only quickly thrown together in a few hours, but it works.",

I'm really proud of the randomized flickering effect I gave the light emitters - when I change them to be actual flames it'll look really cool. I also added mining so that you can get iron ore. Just walk up to a node of iron and click it. You can't do anything with the oe just yet, but it's nice to have the feature implemented.\r\n\r\nI would have gotten a lot more done if I hadn't had a freakin' term paper to do! >:( :P",

You are at the bottom of the sea and the only light that you have is yourself. Well I got lighting working, until I tried to apply it to the fish himself. That caused a bunch of errors that I couldn't get fixed. SO, I made this application that involves 2D raycasting and has nothing to do with the theme. But! I still learned a lot from the competition and most of it involves raycasting. However, I am proud of myself for how far I got and I think that I will be able to do some great things in the next competition. Oh yeah! I also made breakfast. Quite a big one too. So I will make sure that I include a picture of that.",

Yesterday, Jesse made homemade pasta sauce and used that sauce to make four cheese pasta which we had for dinner. That is the food in the skillet. Then I made the focaccia, which is in the background of the picture. The focaccia is an Italian flat bread that is covered in olive oil. Mine was topped with fresh garlic and rosemary, salt and pepper, and Parmesan cheese.\r\n\r\n![alttext](http://i.imgur.com/2k0WUPh.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasuring Cup Rack\r\n\r\nNow I have a handy place for whisks, measuring cups, and measuring spoons.

        "body": "I finished my game, \"Dino Capitalism\", pretty early on this weekend, with 24 hours left to go. It is actually the first game that I have finished to a point where it's playable and actually somewhat fun.You can vote on it [here](http://lookwhatimadeweekend.com/contest/1/submission/32/).\r\n\r\nWhat went right\r\n-------------------\r\nActually, alot went right, which surprised me. When I attempted ludum dare for the first time last summer, I didn't do well at all and had to drop out of the compo. This time around, I was on a roll, 24/7, with little to no interruption. I had a solid theme, right off the bat, and that was capitalism. I wanted to make some form of cookie clicker-esque tycoon game, with more of a focus on finances and money. I got off and started very quickly, and even got some art done which I was very proud of. I am a horrible artist, I don't even know how I was able to paint that decent dinosaur. I managed my priorities, got all the features I wanted implemented, and I got it done quickly. I even managed to make my scripts pretty clean.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong\r\n---------------------\r\nThis morning, I woke up and I decided that I didn't like where my game was headed. I changed it to a first person shooter, decided that wasn't fun, and then moved onto a straight up top down tycoon game. I lost a few precious hours on that, and nearly got demotivated. The biggest problem I ran into though, was Unity. I think after this weekend, I am done with Unity3D for good. The lack of a proper GUI system was nearly when I gave up on the weekend. I was trying desperately to make a GUI system that looked good and could convey information but I just couldn't get it to look well in a small browser window. Eventually I had to compromise and just used plain text with an alright font for the GUI. I wish I could make it better, which I think would make the game alot better, because of all the numbers and data that actually goes into finding the final profit. The other thing that went wrong was the balance of the game. Tomorrow I may go back and fix it up a bit, but it's very easy to get negative taxes and make billions of dollars just by buying a bunch of water coolers. I also wish I could make a better item system that is more modular, but again this is held back by Unity's GUI.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n--------------\r\nI am probably done with my submission. The most I will do is go back tomorrow and make a few bug fixes. I honestly can't stand to use Unity anymore, but after using it for years and running into all of these problems over and over again, I think it's time to move onto greener pastures. I really enjoyed working on my submission though. I hope that we can have another LWIMW again soon, and good luck to all who are still working on their submissions.\r\n\r\nA quick note to david - Great job on the site. Thank you for hosting it, and hosting this game jam. I had alot of fun, and I can't wait to see what everyone comes up with,and do it again. I'm sure all of us who participated are grateful to you for taking the time to do this. I hope you add the ability to view my own submission page and send links to single posts though :) \r\n\r\nHere is the games [source code and source unity project](http://bit.ly/1hjso8X).",

With merely 2 whole minutes left in the Compo, the game was completed, and the submission process begun. I spent a total of about 25+ Hours on the game as a whole, and I'm really happy with the final product.\r\n\r\nWhat Went Right\r\n\r\nWell, being my first successful Game Jam, I'd say a lot wen't right. Although I had to scrap a mechanic at the end because Game Maker refused to work, I am still happy with the way the game turned out. I had trouble with a lot, more than I should have, but through all the headaches, I finished the project, and completed something that was more polished than I thought it would. Overall, not EVERYTHING went right, but at the same time, I'm not at all disappointing with my work.\r\n\r\nWhat Went Wrong\r\n\r\nThis morning I woke up late, I intended to wake up at around 8 to give myself a good 13 hours before submissions, but I ended up waking up at 12:30 instead, and after breakfast, I found myself sitting at 1:00. I got right to work, but I worked a solid 8 hours until 9:00, and working yourself that hard can never be good. So I'll probably take a short break from Game Dev and streaming for a while, maybe about a week, play some Pokemans, enjoy some time on Skype with friends and stuff, (Y'know, normal stuffs that normal peoples do when they aren't making games :D) Virtually nothing went wrong accept for time, and my iffy knowledge on GML going into this game made things slightly more difficult, but I ended up pulling through.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nI'm gonna be updating my submission after my break most likely, but I have a ton of other projects that I'm working on too, so no promises there. I'll fix any bugs, etc that are brought to my attention, and I hope that everyone who plays has as much fun playing it as I did making it. As my first released title I think that it is something to be proud of, and will hopefully give you an idea of what types of games you'll be seeing from me in the near future. Thanks for reading, and I can't wait to play all of your submissions. Also, special thanks to DV for hosting this Jam, I'll never forget where I made my first game.\r\n\r\nYou can download and play the game here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/25h1fnjhg0476og/Switch.exe\r\n\r\nOr the Post-Compo version here:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/2902jdgnp0dzzig/Switch-0-1-1.exe",

There is a HUGE amount of data avaliable on pretty much any region of the world and most of it is for free or atleast cheap.\r\n\r\nUsing this data togheter with either randomly generated, or custom made, meta-data for things like which building are factories, what building accept what goods but also for things like amount of veichles on roads at certain times of the day. This way you can use the huge amount of existing geographical data and combine it with data of your own to create a (hopefully) fun or interesting game.\r\n\r\nThis is my first iteration of the shapefile parser, written in dart (some German town): ",

There is already a walled-off (and insulated) 5 1/2 foot room on the corner that we will repurpose.\r\n\r\nUltimate goal for the weekend: Build enough of the coop so that the chickens can be moved from the basement.\r\n\r\nSubgoals:\r\n\r\n1. Build a secure floor a few feet above the ground.\r\n2. Install windows in the sides of the garage to provide sufficient ventilation.\r\n3. Build a secure door and ramp to the outside that can be easily opened from outside the run (when it gets built).\r\n4. Install linoleum onto the floor to protect it from dampness and line the floor with construction sand (aka chicken litter).\r\n5. Move the chickens!\r\n\r\nGoals that are not part of LWIMW that will need to be accomplished sometime:\r\n\r\n1. Build the run.\r\n2. Build nesting boxes (So the hens will have a place to lay eggs! That is the point of all this, after all.)\r\n\r\n(Attached photo shows a view of the corner room of the garage that will be turned into the coop.)",

I have physical modeling of box-doors working using edge shapes, at least for world-containing edges.\r\n\r\nNext step is to slap in the old adjacency system from an older C# version of this game which I made a few months ago. The adjacency system efficiently calculates slot adjacencies throughout the box tree. Once adjacencies are calculated, I'll be able to use physics sensors (or perhaps the lighter-weight \"slot\" system) to determine objects that need to be partially rendered in multiple boxes and when to transition their physics bodies.\r\n\r\nYeah - I'm definitely not gonna finish on time.
